This shows a walkthrough of Git-Hub Platform.

### Addition made on Git-Hub
On an agile team, stories are something the team can commit to finish within a one- or two-week sprint. Oftentimes, developers would work on dozens of stories a month. Epics, in contrast, are few in number and take longer to complete. Teams often have two or three epics they work to complete each quarter

### Addition made on visual studio code
The same is true for your work management, where the completion of related stories leads to the completion of an epic. The stories tell the arc of the work completed while the epic shares a high-level view of the unifying objective.
